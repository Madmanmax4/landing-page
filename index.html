            From a peaked interest in creating something from nothing, whether it be with wood or creating this website, Wood Mills Ltd. is a one man show. Months of research, the purchase of a used Shopsmith Mark V, a laptop as a Christmas gift and a corner of his parents garage was all he needed to start his dream. With little experience and the will to learn he began his creative journey. To keep up with this journey feel free to sign up for the newsletter.
